# The Rest Stop Finder Web Version

This Rest Stop Finder is sample application based on <a href="https://developer.tomtom.com/maps-sdk-web/tutorials-use-cases/store-locator">Store Locator Tutorial by TomTom</a>.

This map shows our starting point (Codam Coding College), possible rest stop options along the route and the final destination (Barcelona). Clinking on a rest stop option shows the exact address and the facility and safety rating.
